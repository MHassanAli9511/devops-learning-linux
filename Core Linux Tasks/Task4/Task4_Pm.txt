# To view all user processes, cpu/memory usage,PID and cmd names, we use:
ps -aux

to find information about a specific process you can pipeline the cmd into grep:
ps -aux | grep _____

# Monitoring processes on Linux

cmd: top 
Presents all the processes running on Linux, and sorts them by their CPU usage.

A better option for this is htop 


# Background Processes

Two types of processes: Background and Foregorund

If we run, for example ping or sleep, they will run in the foreground, meaning that they will
print out onto the terminal and prevent you from interacting with the terminal at all. 

I can move this process to the background by entering bg %1 ( 1 is it's job number)
or if it is in the background i can move it to the foreground by using fg %1

You can also start a job in the background by using :

ping -c 240 google.com &


# Kill Processes 

Involves terminating a job, by sending a kill signal.
There are various different kill signals, but the main ones are:

SIGTERM : The default kill signal, not as strong

SIGKILL : Forcibly terminate a process

Both ctrl c and ctrl z are kill cmds, they use the signals SIGSTOP and SIGINT respectively.

To use any of these signals, we enter either the signal name or number: 

syntax: 
kill -SIGNAL <PID>
kill -NUMBER <PID>
