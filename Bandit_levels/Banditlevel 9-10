*Explanation*
The strings cmd extracts human readable text from a binary file. 
I first tried to see how much of human readable text was extractable,and because it was too much to
go through, i used grep to find the exact line.


*What I Learned?*
I learned how to obtain readable information from a binary file. I also learned some key usages,
such as: | head , -n __ and | wc -l and | grep.
