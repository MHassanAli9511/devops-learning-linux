## Bandit Level 8 → Level 9


*Challenge*
Password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, and it occurs only once


*Solution*
 sort data.txt | uniq -c


*Password*
4CKMh1JI91bUIZZPXDqGanal4xvAg0JM

*Explanation*
I sorted the file, so the lines are sorted alphabetically, and the duplicates are grouped together.
I then used uniq -c to remove the adjacent duplicate lines and to count the frequency of the
duplicates. So, when i saw the one line with the frequency of 1, i knew that was the password.


*What I Learned?*
I learned about both the sort and uniq cmds. What they do, the different options and how to use 
them together using the pipe. I learned about -c, and just used that to find the password. But, i
did find out about the -u option, which finds unique lines - which would've been a lot more
efficient.
