## Bandit Level 15 → Level 16


*Challenge*
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level
to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.


*Solution*
echo "8xCjnmgoKbGLhHFAZlGE5Tmu4M2tKJQo" | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:30001


*Password*
kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

*Explanation*
We are pipelining the current password to the openssl cmd, which will send the current password to
the server and we will retrieve the password for the next.



*What I Learned?*
What TLS is how TLS-encrypted services can be discovered and interacted with in Linux by combining 
network scanning and secure communication tools.
Using nmap, it is possible to determine whether a host is reachable, which ports are open, and what 
services are listening on those ports.
After identifying the port providing an SSL/TLS service, openssl s_client can be used to establish 
a secure connection and send data to the service in order to retrieve the required response.

This level also reinforced that TLS provides encryption, authentication, and integrity, protecting 
data in transit and ensuring communication occurs with the intended server rather than an attacker.
