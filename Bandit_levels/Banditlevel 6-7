owned by group bandit6
33 bytes in size



*Solution*

ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password


*Password*

*Explanation*
I recognise my 'way' was not as efficient, because i didnt know that you can also search files by
its ownership. So, i searched the files by size, and used grep to locate the bandit files, and
saw one highlighted red that said bandit 7 password. I used cat to display it's content and ls -l
to verify it has the right ownership as per the level objectives.



*What I Learned?*
How to use find cmd, to search across whole system for a file owned by a specific user and group.
