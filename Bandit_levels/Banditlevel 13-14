## Bandit Level 13 → Level 14


*Challenge*
Using a SSH private key to enter into the next level and access its password



*Solution*
scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:/home/bandit13/sshkey.private .
chmod u+x sshkey.private
ssh -i./sshkey.private -p 2220 bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14


*Password*
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

*Explanation*
I used the scp cmd to copy the SSH key into my local directory via the 2220 port. I then made it
executable, so that i can use it to SSH into Bandit 14. Once in, i entered the password for the
current level and cat the password file, because as bandit14 i would have permisson to view it.



*What I Learned?*
How to use a private SSH key for authentication and why key-based login is more secure and
commonly used in real Linux and DevOps environments than password authentication.
