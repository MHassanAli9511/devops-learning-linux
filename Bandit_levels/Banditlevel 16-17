## Bandit Level 16 → Level 17


*Challenge*
Submit the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000.


*Solution*
nmap -vv -p31000-32000 -sV -T5 localhost
echo "kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx" | openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhos
t:31790



*Password*
SSH.privatekey for bandit17

*Explanation*
I used nmap to check what port was reachable, by inputting the range. When learning namp, i found
that -vv, outputs what the cmd is doing, and T5 is used to make the search quciker. This command 
will then run some scans to figure out the services on the ports. 

This is called port enumeration; we are locating a localhost which is serving ssl. In this case
it was port 31790, and then we echo the current password to that port to receive the privatekey for
the next level.



*What I Learned?*
What nmap is and how it can be used to detect ports that are reachable and what services are
listening on them.
What TCP ports are? They are a system of reliable network connections and ports that allow the 
computer to send requests and to recieve signals and direct them to specific programs
