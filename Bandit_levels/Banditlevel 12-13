## Bandit Level 12 → Level 13


*Challenge*
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that
has been repeatedly compressed.


*Solution*
mktemp -d
cd /tmp/tmp.fye6N1owQ6
cp ~/data.txt /tmp/tmp.fye6N1owQ6/
xxd -r data.txt > hexdump.txt
# Then you repeat the following until you get to the ASCII text 
file hexdump.txt
mv filename filename___  (ending is .gz, bz2 or tar based on file type)
gzip -d _____ / bzip2 -d ______ / tar -xf _______

Then:
cat data8


*Password*
FO5dwFsc0cbaIiH0h8J2eUks2vdTDwAn

*Explanation*
I first, as per the instrcutions created a temporary directory to work in. Then i reverted the 
hex dump back into the original file, and redirectd the stdout into a new file. Then i repeated the 
following steps: i checked the file type, changed the filename to have the corresponding ending, 
and decompressed it with either gzip/bzip or tar, until the file type was presented to be readable 
text - ASCII text. I then displayed the content of that final file to obtain the password. 



*What I Learned?*
Using the file cmd to discover the file type of a file, learning how to use xxd, and how to
decompress files, and extract from an archive. 

This level introduced me to archives, how we can create them and how we can extract our 
files from them. Before i attempted this level i did learn what the different options meant: -x,-c
-f, -v and so on. 

To understand this level, it was also necessary to first learn how hexadecimal represents data in
computers. 
Decimal uses a base-10 number system, whereas hexadecimal uses base-16, consisting of the digits 0-9
and A-F
In computing, one hexadecimal digit represents four bits, and two hexadecimal digits represent one
byte (8 bits), which is how characters and file data are stored internally.
Tools such as xxd display file bytes in hexadecimal form and can also reconstruct the original
binary data. The file cmd identifies the file type by using signature bytes at the start of
the file. 

Understanding these concepts made it possible for me to comprehend what i was doing.
