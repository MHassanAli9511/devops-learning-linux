## Bandit Level 10 → Level 11


*Challenge*
Password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data



*Solution*
base64 -d data.txt


*Password*
dtR173fZKb0RRsDFSGsg2RWnpNVj3qRr


*Explanation*
To encode, you input base64, but to decode you add the option -d, which in this case gave me the 
password.


*What I Learned?*
Base64 encodes any data into a safe set of characters. Important distinction, this is not encryption>
It is used so that data can travel through systems safely that only handle text.
