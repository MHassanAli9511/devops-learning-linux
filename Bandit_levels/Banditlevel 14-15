*Explanation*
Used telnet to establish a remote connection to the localhost via port 30000
Then i entered the bandit14 password to obtain the level 15 one. 


*What I Learned?*
Learned for this level, How the internet works, what ports are and what telnet does? Essentially,
telnet is an older and less secure version of connecting to a remote server. Nowadays, while it's
use is limited, it is mainly used for debugging and to test a connection, not for remote access. SSH
is the more secure and modern alternative.
