## Bandit Level 5 → Level 6

*Challenge*
Password stored in a file with the following properties: 
human-readable
1033 bytes in size
not executable


*Solution*
ls
cd inhere
ls
find . -type f -size 1033c
cat ~/inhere/maybehere07/.file2
ls -l ~/inhere/maybehere07/.file2
file /home/bandit5/inhere/maybehere07/.file2


*Password*
HWasnPhtq9AVKe0dmk45nxy20cvUa6EG

*Explanation*
Used the find cmd to find a file with that exact size in the inhere directory. 
Found .file2 , and to verify the other properties, i then used ls -l to check its permissions and
file.... to check if it is human-readable



*What I Learned?*
How to use the find cmd, and i learned the different options we can present to find to find
specific files or directories. For example, in my subsequent learning of this cmd i learned,
to search by:
>Name 
>Entry Type
>Size
>Time Modified
>Permissions
