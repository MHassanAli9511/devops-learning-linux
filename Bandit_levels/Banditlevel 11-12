## Bandit Level 11 → Level 12


*Challenge*
Password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase
(A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions


*Solution*
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'


*Password*
7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4

*Explanation*
Displayed the contents of the file, and used the tr cmd to apply the ROT13 substitution, to reveal
the password for the next level



*What I Learned?*
The text in this level was obfuscated by the ROT13 substitution, so we had to use tr to decode it.

ROT13 is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the alphabet is shifted 13 positions.
Because the English alphabet has 26 letters, applying ROT13 twice returns the text to its original form.

This method is considered obfuscation, meaning the text is deliberately made harder to read without being permanently encrypted.

To decode ROT13 in Linux, the tr command is used to map:

the original alphabet → A-Za-z

the shifted alphabet → N-ZA-Mn-za-m

Both character sets must be the same length so each letter maps correctly.
ROT13 is symmetrical, so the translation works in either direction.
