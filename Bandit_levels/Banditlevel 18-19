## Bandit Level 18 → Level 19


*Challenge*
Password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, 
someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.



*Solution*
ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "cat readme"



*Password*
cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8

*Explanation*
I logged into the remote system and executed a command directly during the SSH connection to read 
the readme file, which ouputted the password


*What I Learned?*
I learned how to run a cmd non-interactively over SSH, and why this technique is useful, when
normal shell access is restricted.
