## Bandit Level 19 → Level 20


*Challenge*
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. 
Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found 
in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

*Solution*
./bandit20-do whoami
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20


*Password*
0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO

*Explanation*
I used the setuid to run whoami, as instrcuted by the terminal output, this confirmed that the cmd 
executes with bandit20 privileges. So i used it to cat/read the file to obtain the password.



*What I Learned?*
What setuid is and how setuid programs execute cmds with another user's permissions. The
file/program was temporarily acting as bandit20. This is an example of privilege escalation;
we are the bandit19 user, but the program lets you act as bandit 20. This is a key mechanism in 
system tasks like users changing their password.
